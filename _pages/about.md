I'm a third-year PhD student in Theoretical Chemistry at Stanford, working on GPU-accelerated quantum chemistry methods for complex chemical systems. My research focuses on developing efficient, GPU-native algorithms for quantum chemistry methods and combining machine learning with physics-based methods for automated reaction discovery.

Here I also dump all my random doodles and other arts and will hopefully witness some progress along the way. 'The Milky Way in My Reach' is a crude translation of "天河在袖", a rather random (but unbelievably beautiful, in my opinion) phrase from an ancient Chinese prose.

The original theme is [Starving Artist](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/starving-artist-jekyll-theme). Many thanks to the author!
