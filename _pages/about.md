I'm a third-year PhD student in Theoretical Chemistry at Stanford, working on GPU-accelerated quantum chemistry methods for complex chemical systems.

My research focuses on developing efficient algorithms for multi-reference quantum chemistry methods, particularly Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculations. These methods are essential for studying challenging chemical processes like bond breaking, excited states, and catalysis—problems that require going beyond standard density functional theory approaches.

I've developed GPU-native implementations using CUDA that achieve over 40× speedup in electron repulsion integral construction and 10× speedup in CASSCF calculations. This work enables large-scale simulations of photochemical reactions and excited-state dynamics that were previously computationally prohibitive. I'm currently extending this work toward tensor hyper-contraction methods that could scale to systems with over 10,000 basis functions.

Beyond quantum chemistry, I'm interested in the intersection of AI and simulation, working on projects that combine machine learning with physics-based methods for automated chemical discovery.

Here I also dump all my random doodles and other arts and will hopefully witness some progress along the way. 'The Milky Way in My Reach' is a crude translation of "天河在袖", a rather random (but unbelievably beautiful, in my opinion) phrase from an ancient Chinese prose.
