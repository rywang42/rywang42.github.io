## Research Experience

### [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) *Stanford, CA, USA*
**Graduate Research Assistant** (February 2024 -- Present)
Advisor: [Professor Todd J. Martínez](https://mtzweb.stanford.edu/)
- **GPU-native DF-CASSCF (TeraChem)** — designed and implemented density-fitting ERI construction and GPU kernels (McMurchie–Davidson integrals, 2/3-center routines). Focuses include integral recasting as BLAS-friendly tensor contractions, memory-hierarchy optimizations, and Nsight-driven bottleneck elimination.
- **Mixed-precision strategies & kernel engineering** — performed experiments with TF32/FP16 emulation and precision-binning of integrals to trade accuracy and throughput on AI-optimized tensor units.
- **Sparsity-aware THC research** — prototyped Tensor Hyper-Contraction for multireference methods.
- **Nanoreactor / AI + simulation integration** — benchmarked DFT vs ML interatomic potentials and developed automated reaction-cycle detection and manifold-learning analyses.
- **Software engineering & tooling** — refactored and modularized TeraChem components (C/C++), maintained and upgraded the Nanoreactor codebase (Python), added testing/CI-friendly interfaces, and profiled/optimized kernels for multi-GPU workflows.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant** (September 2023 -- June 2024)
General chemistry (CHEM31M, Fall 2023) and organic chemistry (CHEM33, Winter & Spring 2024)
